Everything inside the Game.tscn scene will be rendered with two colors from the official palette while also applying an ordered dithering shader.

## Recommendations for best results
1. Load images in LossLess or VRAM Uncompressed Modes
2. If using 2D, only use whole pixels (not fractional pixels (ie. Having something positioned at 1.5, 1.5))
